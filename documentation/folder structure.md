## Folder Structure

### node_modules

This directory houses the folders and files of installed dependencies. Notably, these files are omitted from version control (e.g., GitHub). The analogy here is akin to a recipe book; only the description of the required modules is shared, allowing seamless reproduction on other systems using npm install.

### src

The heart of the project resides in the src folder. It serves as the workspace where application structure and components are crafted, defining the core functionality of the application.

### src

Public assets

### .eslintrc.cjs:

The presence of this file signifies the configuration of ESLint, a versatile and customizable linting tool. ESLint aids in maintaining code quality by identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It acts as a proactive measure, catching issues such as undeclared variables, variable redeclarations, constant value alterations, unnecessary parentheses, and syntactic errors.

### index.html:

This file hosts the root element of our application. As the entry point, the application goes to this HTML document during runtime.

### README.md:

In the tradition of conventional README files, this markdown document serves to provide a comprehensive description of the project. It facilitates understanding for fellow developers, offering insights into the application's purpose and functionality, thereby minimizing the effort required to comprehend the intricacies independently.

### package.json

Functioning as the recipe book for our project, package.json encapsulates essential information. It outlines core dependencies, project scripts, and project specifications, forming a comprehensive guide for the application's structure and behavior.

### vite.config.js:

This configuration file plays a pivotal role in shaping the behavior of the Vite development environment. It allows for fine-tuning and customization, providing a tailored development experience to meet specific project requirements.

In subsequent blogs, we will delve deeper into each aspect of this structure, unraveling the intricacies of Vite applications and empowering developers with a profound understanding of each component. Stay tuned for an enlightening journey through React development intricacies.
